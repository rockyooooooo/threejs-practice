Just a practice of the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) which is done by following the [Getting Started](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) of the three.js official page.

To finish this practice I also watched [Build a Mindblowing 3D Portfolio Website // Three.js Beginnerâ€™s Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Q7AOvWpIVHU) which is made by Jeff.

Shout out to Jeff.

Run the following command to serve the page.
